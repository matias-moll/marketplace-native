React Native Marketplace app

Using Expo I got into React Native to develop fast a full mobile app with:
  - Login 
  - Location usage 
  - Listings 
  - Ability to create a listing 
  - User settings 
  - Different navigators 
  - Camera interface
  - Much more!

Based on a tutorial getting to know the technology and its capabilities.

This gave me the tools to create the technicians mobile app for a client I already had with desktop and webapp system in place. 
It gave me a huge selling point and opportunity to help them improve their business and me improve my skills while getting a new sell.
